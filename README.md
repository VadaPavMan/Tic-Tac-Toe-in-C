# Tic-Tac-Toe in C üïπÔ∏è

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C. The game can be played between two players on the same machine. It includes the following features:

- Players can choose between 'X' and 'O' to mark their positions.
- The game displays a board where players can input their moves by selecting a number corresponding to the board position.
- A win-check mechanism identifies when a player has won.
- The game detects if the match is a draw.
- The scoreboard keeps track of how many rounds each player has won.
- Option to play again or exit after each game.

This project was built as a fun way to practice C programming, especially focusing on logic, loops, and arrays. Feel free to clone, play, and improve upon the project!
