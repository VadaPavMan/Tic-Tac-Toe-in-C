- The game displays a board where players can input their moves by selecting a number corresponding to the board position.
- A win-check mechanism identifies when a player has won.
- The game detects if the match is a draw.
- The scoreboard keeps track of how many rounds each player has won.
- Option to play again or exit after each game.
